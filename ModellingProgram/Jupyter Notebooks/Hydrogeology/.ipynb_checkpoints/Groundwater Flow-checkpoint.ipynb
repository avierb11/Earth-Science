    "## Bernoulli's Equation\n",
    "<p>Bernoulli's equation is an equation that describes the energy that a fluid has. The energy of a fluid can be contained in kinetic energy, gravitation potential energy, and pressure energy: </p>\n",

    "<p>Where $h$ is the <b>hydraulic head</b>, given in units of length. In the ground, the water flows so slowly that the velocity term is negligible, and can therefore be taken away. In the equation, each of the terms on the right side of the equation are referred to as the <b>velocity head</b>, <b>elevation head</b>, and <b>pressure head</b>. The equation that I use for my equations is then:</p>\n",

By this equation, it is shown that if the water is at hydrostatic equilibrium, the head is equal at any point in it. Additionally, for an unconfined aquifer, the pressure at the top of the aquifer is equal to atmosphereic pressure, which is set to zero. Hydraulic head can be measured using a piezometer.</p>\n",

I cannot simulate flow in every direction, so instead I simulate it by determining the flow on all 4 sides of the cube. With a model that is sufficiently discretized and taken with a sufficiently small time step, this function simulates radial flow quite well, with boxes that fall very near a given circle radius having nearly identical hydraulic head values, after some time.
