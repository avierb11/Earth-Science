<h1>Goals of the project</h1>
<container>
<p class="main">I am trying to create a groundwater flow simluation program. The scope of the
    project is not yet very defined, but I would like it to focus mainly around
    human and environmental health. <br>
    Being that I am sequestered at home during the pandemic, I figured that
    I had better try to make the best of this time. I am a fan of computers, and
    I like to challenge myself, and this project sure is a project. From only
    the basic things I've done so far, I've been challenged and frustrated
    more than I though possible. But that's really the way it should be.
